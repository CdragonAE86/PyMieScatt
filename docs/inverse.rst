   Computes complex *m = n+ik* from a particle diameter (in nm), incident wavelength (in nm), and scattering and absorption efficiencies. Optionally, backscatter efficiency may be specified to constrain the problem to produce a unique solution.
   
   **Parameters**
   
   
   Qsca : float or list-like
	The scattering efficiency, or optionally, a list, tuple, or numpy.ndarray of scattering efficiency and its associated error.
   Qabs : float or list-like
	The absorption efficiency, or optionally, a list, tuple, or numpy.ndarray of absorption efficiency and its associated error..
   wavelength : float
	The wavelength of incident light, in nm.
   diameter : float
	The diameter of the particle, in nm.
   n : float or list-like, optional
	An assumed real refractive index. Can be used in case scattering data is not available. If specified as a list, it **must** have only two elements. The first is the assumed *n* and the second is an uncertainty, such as a standard deviation.
   k : float or list-like, optional
	An assumed imaginary refractive index. Useful if only considering nonabsorbing aerosols, so you can set k=0. If specified as a list, it **must** have only two elements. The first is the assumed *k* and the second is an uncertainty, such as a standard deviation. **Note: when specifying this in the function call, input it as a real number. Omit the imaginary unit.
   nMin : float, optional
	The minimum value of *n* to search.
   nMax : float, optional
	The maximum value of *n* to search.
   kMin : float, optional
	The minimum value of *k* to search.
   kMax : float, optional
	The maximum value of *k* to search.
   Qback : float or list-like, optional
	The backscatter efficiency, or optionally, a list, tuple, or numpy.ndarray of backscatter efficiency and its associated error.
   gridPoints : int, optional
	The number of gridpoints for the search mesh. Defaults to 200. Increase for better resolution but longer run times.
   interpolationFactor : int, optional
	The interpolation to apply to the search fields, artificially increasing their resolutions. This is applied after calculations, so some features may be lost if **interpolationFactor** is too high and **gridPoints** is too low.
   maxError : float, optional
	The allowed error in forward calculations of the retrived *m*.
   fig : matplotlib.figure object, optional (but recommended)
	The figure object to send to the geometric inversion routine. If unspecified, one will be created.
   ax : matplotlib.axes object, optional (but recommended)
	The axes object to send to the geometric inversion routine. If unspecified, one will be created.
   axisOption : int, optional
	Dictates the axis scales. Kind of useless since version 1.3.0. It's still around until I get rid of it. Acceptable parameters are:
	
	- '0' for automatic detection of best axis scaling
	- '1' for linear axes
	- '2' for linear x and logarithmic y
	- '3' for logarithmic x and linear y

   ax : matplotlib.axes object

   graphElements : dict
	A dict of all artists necessary to fully manipulate the appearance of the output. The keys will depend on the options passed to the inversion function itself (i.e., errors specified, backscatter specified). Maximally, it will contain:
	
	- 'Qsca', 'Qabs', 'Qback' - the major contours;
	- 'QscaErrFill', 'QscaErrOutline1', 'QscaErrOutline2' - the error bound contours;

Survey-iteration Inversion Functions
------------------------------------

The survey-iteration inversion algorithm is discussed in detail in the Supplementary Material of the JQSRT paper. It is a strictly numerical two phase algorithm. First, a low-resolution survey of *n-k* space is conducted and values of efficiencies or coefficients close to the inputs are located. From this survey, candidate *m* values are determined. The iteration phase is best described by this flowchart:
